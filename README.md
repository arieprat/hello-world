# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub account. Hope this will make me improve and upgrade my skill in programming.

I create GitHub for increaase my opportunity to work and build career in Data Scientist. I once heard from other people if you want to make career in Data Science, or Programming in general, what to do is build a portfolio about your work. And GitHub is one of many tools for creating portfolio. And I heard if certificate is not so must-have if want to build career in Data science.
